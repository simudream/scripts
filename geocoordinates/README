Script for retrieving worldwide location data comprised of location name, latitude, longitude, country name and country code.

The intent of this project is to make this subset of the data more easily retrievable and convertable into alternate formats including JSON, CSV and SQL.

The data provided is accurate to six decimal places. For a representation of what this means please see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_degrees#Accuracy
